# Supply Chain Models

**âœ… Implemented and Production Ready**

This directory contains dbt models for supply chain optimization analysis, providing comprehensive insights into inventory management, material flow, and operational efficiency.

## Implemented Models

### Staging Models
- `stg_supply_chain_data.sql` - Supply chain performance and cost data

### Fact Models
- `fact_supply_chain_monthly.sql` - Monthly supply chain KPIs and metrics

### Mart Models
- `mart_supply_chain_summary.sql` - Supply chain performance summary and insights

## Key Metrics & Insights

### Inventory Management
- **Inventory Turnover**: Efficiency of inventory management
- **Stock Levels**: Current and optimal inventory levels
- **Material Flow**: Tracking of sustainable materials through the supply chain
- **Lead Times**: Supplier and delivery performance

### Operational Efficiency
- **Cost Analysis**: Supply chain cost breakdown and optimization
- **Performance Metrics**: Supplier and logistics efficiency
- **Quality Metrics**: Product quality and compliance tracking
- **Sustainability Impact**: ESG metrics across the supply chain

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Cost Reduction**: Identify areas for cost optimization
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Process optimization recommendations
- **Sustainability Enhancements**: ESG improvement opportunities
- **Risk Management**: Supply chain risk assessment and mitigation

## Integration with ESG & Finance

These models integrate with existing ESG and Finance models to provide:
- Supply chain impact on ESG metrics
- Cost implications of sustainable sourcing
- End-to-end value chain analysis
- Supplier sustainability compliance
- Financial impact of supply chain decisions

## Data Sources

- Supply chain performance data
- Inventory management systems
- Supplier performance metrics
- Transportation and logistics data
- Quality management systems
- Cost and procurement data

## Data Quality & Testing

The supply chain models include comprehensive data quality tests:
- Range validation for all metrics
- Business logic verification
- Data completeness checks
- Referential integrity validation
- Performance benchmarks

## Usage Examples

### Monthly Supply Chain Report
```sql
SELECT 
    month,
    inventory_turnover,
    total_cost,
    sustainability_score,
    efficiency_rating
FROM {{ ref('fact_supply_chain_monthly') }}
ORDER BY month DESC
```

### Supply Chain Summary Dashboard
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    avg_cost,
    avg_efficiency,
    sustainability_impact
FROM {{ ref('mart_supply_chain_summary') }}
WHERE category IS NOT NULL
```

## Performance & Optimization

- **Query Optimization**: Efficient SQL queries for large datasets
- **Incremental Processing**: Support for incremental model updates
- **Data Freshness**: Regular data refresh capabilities
- **Scalability**: Designed for enterprise-scale data volumes
